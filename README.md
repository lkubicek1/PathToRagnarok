# Path to Ragnarok (PTR)

Path to Ragnarok is an ambitious, large-scale multiplayer online game that combines elements of survival, real-time strategy, and role-playing games. It challenges players to survive, explore, and expand their reach in a vast, procedurally generated universe on the brink of a cataclysmic event. The game features a unique Seal unlocking system, dynamic NPC quests, and a rich economy and resource management system.

## Overview

Players must band together to form clans, build bases, and research technology to unlock Seals, which represent critical stages of technological progress. As they unlock Seals, players will gain access to advanced vehicles, weapons, and abilities that will allow them to explore and conquer new territories. PvP combat and base raiding are integral aspects of the game, with players vying for control of territory and resources.

The game also features a rich storyline and lore that builds intrigue and mystery around the nature of the game universe. Players will uncover easter eggs and hints that allude to an ancient cataclysm and warnings against pushing the limits of technology too far.
