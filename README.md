## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok (PTR)_ is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game that combines elements of survival, exploration, and technological progression in an open-world/universe setting. Players start on a single planet in a primitive state and work together or compete to research and unlock advanced technologies through a unique "Seal" system. The game's narrative and mechanics are designed to encourage cooperation, competition, and social interaction, fostering a dynamic and engaging player experience.

The game world evolves as players unlock Seals and progress through technology research trees. The ultimate goal is to reach the final Seal, "Transcendence," which triggers the end of the universe and a complete reset of the game world. Each play session is expected to last between 3 and 6 months, depending on player activity, and leaderboards track top performers from previous sessions.

In _Path to Ragnarok_, players can join Clans, build bases and research facilities, engage in player-versus-player (PvP) combat, participate in quests and storyline events, and explore a vast, ever-changing universe. The game's design and mechanics are focused on delivering an immersive and engaging player experience.

This Game Design Document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development of _Path to Ragnarok_, outlining its core mechanics, gameplay systems, monetization strategies, and more.
