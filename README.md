This Game Design Document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development of _Path to Ragnarok_, outlining its core mechanics, gameplay systems, monetization strategies, and more.

## Gameplay Overview <a name="gameplay-overview"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game set in an open-world/universe, where players begin their journey on a single, shared planet. The core gameplay revolves around technological progression, exploration, and survival, with players unlocking new capabilities through a series of Seals.

### Starting Conditions

Players spawn on the planet in a primitive state, possibly naked, and must rely on basic survival gameplay mechanics to progress. They'll gather resources, craft tools, build shelters, and develop their characters as they advance through technology research trees.

### Seals and Progression

The Seal system serves as the backbone of the game's progression mechanics. Players research and unlock Seals, which grant access to new technology research trees, enabling more advanced gameplay features. Seals are divided into three categories: early game, mid game, and end game, each corresponding to a different phase of the game.

### Clans and Social Interaction

To encourage cooperation and interaction among players, _Path to Ragnarok_ features a "Clan" system, allowing players to band together and work toward common goals. Clans can build bases, research facilities, and engage in diplomacy or conflict with other clans.

### Base Building and Industry

As players progress, they'll construct bases and develop industries to support their technological advancement. Bases can be built for various purposes, such as research, resource production, defense, and more.

### NPC System

_Path to Ragnarok_ features a robust NPC system, with various types of NPCs populating the game world. As players unlock Seals and advance through research trees, they will encounter roaming nomads, bustling cities, and more. NPCs can be interacted with in different ways, such as fighting, bartering, or forming alliances.

Cities offer a safe haven for players, providing a relatively secure environment where they can engage in trade and social activities. Strong NPC guards protect these cities, ensuring that unsolicited PvP is deterred and maintaining a sense of safety for players within city walls.

### Exploration and Transportation <a name="exploration-and-transportation"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ offers a vast, ever-changing universe for players to explore. As they advance through the Seals, players will unlock various forms of transportation, including ground vehicles, aircraft, and spaceships, enabling them to travel further and discover new celestial bodies and resources.

As the game progresses and more Seals are unlocked, the NPC system will evolve, with more advanced NPC civilizations emerging throughout the universe. Players can discover and interact with these civilizations in various ways, such as trading, forming alliances, or engaging in conflict.

Exploring the game world and encountering new NPC civilizations can lead to unique opportunities and challenges, providing players with a rich and diverse gameplay experience.

### End Game and Universe Reset

The ultimate goal in _Path to Ragnarok_ is to research the final Seal, "Trancedance," which triggers the end of the universe and resets the game world. Each play session is expected to last between 3 and 6 months, depending on player activity. Leaderboards track top performers from previous sessions, and players can carry over certain accomplishments or rewards to the next play session.


## Seals and Technology Progression <a name="seals-and-technology-progression"></a>

The Seal system is at the core of _Path to Ragnarok_'s gameplay, driving technological progression and shaping the game world. Seals are unlocked globally, meaning that once a Clan unlocks a Seal, the subsequent research trees associated with that Seal become available to all players and Clans.

### Shared Global Unlocks

When a Seal is unlocked, the entire player base benefits from the new technologies and gameplay features it brings. This design encourages cooperation and competition among Clans, as they race to unlock Seals and contribute to the global advancement of the game world.

### Individual and Clan Research Trees

While Seals are shared globally, the research trees within each Seal are available only to individual players or Clans. Players can progress through these research trees at their own pace, unlocking new capabilities and technologies. Joining a Clan can accelerate this process, as experience and research progress are shared among Clan members.

## Clan and Social Interaction System <a name="clan-and-social-interaction"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ encourages player cooperation and social interaction through the implementation of a Clan system. Clans serve as a central hub for players to collaborate, work together, and share resources, research progress, and experiences.

### Forming and Joining Clans

Players can either create their own Clan or join an existing one. Creating a Clan requires meeting certain criteria, such as having a minimum number of members and resources. Joining a Clan is typically as simple as submitting an application or accepting an invitation from a Clan leader or member.

### Clan Benefits

Members of a Clan benefit from shared resources, research progress, and experiences. By pooling resources and working together, Clans can unlock Seals and research trees more quickly, allowing members to advance at a faster pace than they would individually.

### Clan Bases and Facilities <a name="clan-bases-and-facilities"></a>

Clans can construct bases and various facilities, such as research labs, resource production centers, and defensive structures. These bases serve as a focal point for Clan activities and provide a physical space for members to gather, plan, and collaborate on projects.

Bases are also vulnerable to attack from other players, Clans, or NPCs, which encourages strategic planning and competition between players. Clans must carefully design and defend their bases, balancing resource production and research capabilities with the need for strong defenses and security measures.

This added layer of strategic gameplay promotes cooperation within Clans, as members must work together to plan, build, and maintain their bases while fending off potential threats from rival Clans or aggressive NPCs.



### Diplomacy and Conflict

Clans can engage in diplomacy with other Clans, forging alliances or engaging in trade agreements. Conversely, Clans can also come into conflict with one another, leading to battles or even full-scale wars over resources, territory, or ideological differences.

### Safe Havens and City Interaction

Cities in _Path to Ragnarok_ offer a safe haven for players, providing a relatively secure environment where they can engage in trade and social activities. Strong NPC guards protect these cities, ensuring that unsolicited PvP is deterred and maintaining a sense of safety for players within city walls. Clans can use cities as a neutral ground for diplomacy, trade, or recruitment.

## Economy and Resource Management <a name="economy-and-resource-management"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ features a dynamic economy and resource management system that is integral to the progression and success of players and Clans. As players advance through the Seals, they will need to manage resources carefully and engage in trade with other players and NPCs to support their growth.

### Resource Gathering and Production

Players gather and produce resources by engaging in various activities such as mining, farming, and crafting. These resources are essential for base construction, research, crafting items, and maintaining facilities. The availability and production rate of resources can be influenced by factors such as the player's location, technological advancement, and environmental conditions.

### Trading and Commerce

Trading plays a crucial role in the game's economy, allowing players to exchange resources, crafted items, and services with other players and NPCs. As players progress and unlock new Seals, they will gain access to more advanced trading systems, such as regional markets, auction houses, and interstellar trade networks.

### Currency

The game features a currency system that facilitates trade between players and NPCs. As players unlock the Currency and Trade Seal, they gain access to a monetary system that can be used to purchase goods and services, such as items, equipment, and transportation.

### Resource Management within Clans

Clans must work together to effectively manage their shared resources, as these resources are vital to the construction and maintenance of Clan bases, facilities, and research projects. Effective resource management can mean the difference between a thriving, successful Clan and one that struggles to keep up with its competitors.
