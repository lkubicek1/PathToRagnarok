This Game Design Document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development of _Path to Ragnarok_, outlining its core mechanics, gameplay systems, monetization strategies, and more.

## Gameplay Overview <a name="gameplay-overview"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game set in an open-world/universe, where players begin their journey on a single, shared planet. The core gameplay revolves around technological progression, exploration, and survival, with players unlocking new capabilities through a series of Seals.

### Starting Conditions

Players spawn on the planet in a primitive state, possibly naked, and must rely on basic survival gameplay mechanics to progress. They'll gather resources, craft tools, build shelters, and develop their characters as they advance through technology research trees.

### Seals and Progression

The Seal system serves as the backbone of the game's progression mechanics. Players research and unlock Seals, which grant access to new technology research trees, enabling more advanced gameplay features. Seals are divided into three categories: early game, mid game, and end game, each corresponding to a different phase of the game.

### Clans and Social Interaction

To encourage cooperation and interaction among players, _Path to Ragnarok_ features a "Clan" system, allowing players to band together and work toward common goals. Clans can build bases, research facilities, and engage in diplomacy or conflict with other clans.

### Base Building and Industry

As players progress, they'll construct bases and develop industries to support their technological advancement. Bases can be built for various purposes, such as research, resource production, defense, and more.

### NPC System

_Path to Ragnarok_ features a robust NPC system, with various types of NPCs populating the game world. As players unlock Seals and advance through research trees, they will encounter roaming nomads, bustling cities, and more. NPCs can be interacted with in different ways, such as fighting, bartering, or forming alliances.

Cities offer a safe haven for players, providing a relatively secure environment where they can engage in trade and social activities. Strong NPC guards protect these cities, ensuring that unsolicited PvP is deterred and maintaining a sense of safety for players within city walls.

### Exploration and Transportation <a name="exploration-and-transportation"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ offers a vast, ever-changing universe for players to explore. As they advance through the Seals, players will unlock various forms of transportation, including ground vehicles, aircraft, and spaceships, enabling them to travel further and discover new celestial bodies and resources.

As the game progresses and more Seals are unlocked, the NPC system will evolve, with more advanced NPC civilizations emerging throughout the universe. Players can discover and interact with these civilizations in various ways, such as trading, forming alliances, or engaging in conflict.

Exploring the game world and encountering new NPC civilizations can lead to unique opportunities and challenges, providing players with a rich and diverse gameplay experience.

### End Game and Universe Reset

The ultimate goal in _Path to Ragnarok_ is to research the final Seal, "Transcendence," which triggers the end of the universe and resets the game world. Each play Season is expected to last between 3 and 6 months, depending on player activity. Leaderboards track top performers from previous Seasons, and players can carry over certain accomplishments or rewards to the next play Season.


## Seals and Technology Progression <a name="seals-and-technology-progression"></a>

The Seal system is at the core of _Path to Ragnarok_'s gameplay, driving technological progression and shaping the game world. Seals are unlocked globally, meaning that once a Clan unlocks a Seal, the subsequent research trees associated with that Seal become available to all players and Clans.

### Shared Global Unlocks

When a Seal is unlocked, the entire player base benefits from the new technologies and gameplay features it brings. This design encourages cooperation and competition among Clans, as they race to unlock Seals and contribute to the global advancement of the game world.

### Individual and Clan Research Trees

While Seals are shared globally, the research trees within each Seal are available only to individual players or Clans. Players can progress through these research trees at their own pace, unlocking new capabilities and technologies. Joining a Clan can accelerate this process, as experience and research progress are shared among Clan members.

## Clan and Social Interaction System <a name="clan-and-social-interaction"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ encourages player cooperation and social interaction through the implementation of a Clan system. Clans serve as a central hub for players to collaborate, work together, and share resources, research progress, and experiences.

### Forming and Joining Clans

Players can either create their own Clan or join an existing one. Creating a Clan requires meeting certain criteria, such as having a minimum number of members and resources. Joining a Clan is typically as simple as submitting an application or accepting an invitation from a Clan leader or member.

### Clan Benefits

Members of a Clan benefit from shared resources, research progress, and experiences. By pooling resources and working together, Clans can unlock Seals and research trees more quickly, allowing members to advance at a faster pace than they would individually.

### Clan Bases and Facilities <a name="clan-bases-and-facilities"></a>

Clans can construct bases and various facilities, such as research labs, resource production centers, and defensive structures. These bases serve as a focal point for Clan activities and provide a physical space for members to gather, plan, and collaborate on projects.

Bases are also vulnerable to attack from other players, Clans, or NPCs, which encourages strategic planning and competition between players. Clans must carefully design and defend their bases, balancing resource production and research capabilities with the need for strong defenses and security measures.

This added layer of strategic gameplay promotes cooperation within Clans, as members must work together to plan, build, and maintain their bases while fending off potential threats from rival Clans or aggressive NPCs.

### Diplomacy and Conflict

Clans can engage in diplomacy with other Clans, forging alliances or engaging in trade agreements. Conversely, Clans can also come into conflict with one another, leading to battles or even full-scale wars over resources, territory, or ideological differences.

### Safe Havens and City Interaction

Cities in _Path to Ragnarok_ offer a safe haven for players, providing a relatively secure environment where they can engage in trade and social activities. Strong NPC guards protect these cities, ensuring that unsolicited PvP is deterred and maintaining a sense of safety for players within city walls. Clans can use cities as a neutral ground for diplomacy, trade, or recruitment.

## Economy and Resource Management <a name="economy-and-resource-management"></a>

_Path to Ragnarok_ features a dynamic economy and resource management system that is integral to the progression and success of players and Clans. As players advance through the Seals, they will need to manage resources carefully and engage in trade with other players and NPCs to support their growth.

### Resource Gathering and Production

Players gather and produce resources by engaging in various activities such as mining, farming, and crafting. These resources are essential for base construction, research, crafting items, and maintaining facilities. The availability and production rate of resources can be influenced by factors such as the player's location, technological advancement, and environmental conditions.

### Trading and Commerce

Trading plays a crucial role in the game's economy, allowing players to exchange resources, crafted items, and services with other players and NPCs. As players progress and unlock new Seals, they will gain access to more advanced trading systems, such as regional markets, auction houses, and interstellar trade networks.

### Currency <a name="currency"></a>

The game features a dynamic currency system that evolves as players progress through the Currency and Trade Seal, facilitating trade between players and NPCs. This system is deeply tied to the lore of the game, reflecting the technological advancements and cultural shifts that take place as players unlock new Seals and research trees.

#### Early-Game Currency: Coins and Bonds

In the early stages of the game, players will use traditional forms of currency such as coins and bonds. These currencies are relatively simple and will be familiar to players, allowing for straightforward trade and commerce in the early stages of the game.

#### Late-Game Currency: Digital Currency - Fenrir Shards (Fs) and Lokis

As players progress through the Currency and Trade Seal research tree, they will gain access to a more advanced form of currency, a unique digital currency called Fenrir Shards (Fs). This name is inspired by Fenrir, the monstrous wolf from Norse mythology that is said to play a significant role in Ragnarok.

For everyday trading and smaller transactions, a smaller denomination of the digital currency called "Lokis" will also be introduced. Named after the Norse trickster god Loki, Lokis serve as a convenient and easily divisible currency for players to use in their daily in-game activities.

The transition to Fenrir Shards and Lokis reflects the increased technological sophistication of the game world, as players move beyond physical coins and bonds and into a more secure and efficient digital economy. With a strong connection to the themes of Ragnarok and Armageddon, Fenrir Shards and Lokis serve as symbolic currencies for a world on the brink of a cataclysmic event.

### Resource Management within Clans

Clans must work together to effectively manage their shared resources, as these resources are vital to the construction and maintenance of Clan bases, facilities, and research projects. Effective resource management can mean the difference between a thriving, successful Clan and one that struggles to keep up with its competitors.

### Base Building and Territory Control <a name="base-building"></a>

Base building and territory control play a crucial role in players' progression through the game, particularly during the mid and late stages. Players will have the opportunity to construct intricate and expansive bases, manage resources, and optimize production lines to support their technological advancement and research efforts.

#### Terrestrial Bases

In the early and mid-game, players will focus on constructing bases on the surface of planets. These bases will be essential for resource gathering, crafting, research, and defense against potential threats from other players, clans, or NPCs. Players will need to strategically plan their bases, considering factors such as resource availability, terrain, and proximity to potential allies or enemies.

#### Space Bases and Freighters

As players progress into the late game and unlock advanced space exploration technologies, they will have the option to build massive space freighters that function as mobile bases. These freighters can be directly controlled by clans, allowing them to traverse the vastness of space and establish orbital bases around alien planets and moons.

These orbital bases will enable players to extend their territory control, access new resources, and establish a strategic presence in the cosmos. With the ability to move bases between celestial bodies, clans can quickly adapt to changing circumstances and take advantage of emerging opportunities throughout the universe.

### Nexus: The Seal Monolith

To align with the Seal unlocking mechanic, players will have to build a monumental structure called a "Nexus." This massive monolith will serve as the central research hub where resources and materials are gathered to unlock the current Seal.

Any player can bring resources and research to the Nexus, earning currency or research experience in return. However, the clan that originally constructed the Nexus will receive an additional bonus. This shared, cooperative approach to unlocking Seals encourages player collaboration and interaction within the game world.

The Nexus is indestructible and will be visibly marked on in-game world maps. As a result, these structures can become hotspots for PvP encounters, as players make pilgrimages to contribute to the Seal unlocking process. This dynamic adds an additional layer of excitement and challenge to the game, as players must balance the benefits of contributing to the Nexus with the risks of potential conflict.

## Player vs. Player (PvP) Combat <a name="pvp"></a>

PvP combat is a core aspect of the game and offers players an exciting and challenging way to engage with others, compete for resources, and establish dominance. The PvP mechanics evolve throughout the game, with early-game combat featuring melee, primitive weapons, and firearms, while late-game combat introduces advanced weapons, vehicles, and space battles.

### Early-Game PvP Mechanics

During the early stages of the game, players will engage in PvP combat primarily through melee combat and primitive ranged weapons. As players progress and unlock new technologies, firearms will become available, leading to more dynamic and varied combat situations. Most early-game PvP combat will occur in first-person shooter (FPS) mode, allowing for immersive and intense battles.

### Late-Game PvP Mechanics

As the game advances and players unlock more sophisticated technologies, the PvP combat mechanics will expand to include advanced weaponry and vehicles. Players will engage in aerial dogfights, participate in massive space battles, and even control powerful mech vehicles.

These late-game combat scenarios will provide an exhilarating experience, as players will have to master new combat tactics and strategies while adapting to the ever-evolving technology and environments.

### Vehicle Mechanics

In the mid to late game, players will have the opportunity to pilot and command a diverse range of vehicles, including ground vehicles, aircraft, space ships, and powerful mechs. These vehicles will offer players unique tactical advantages and powerful new ways to engage in PvP combat.

Ground vehicles will enhance players' mobility and firepower on the terrestrial battlegrounds, allowing for faster traversal and effective combat support. Aircraft will offer players the ability to engage in high-speed aerial dogfights, providing a thrilling combat experience and the chance to control the skies.

Space ships will play a crucial role in the late game, as players unlock the ability to explore the cosmos and engage in massive space battles. These battles will require strategic thinking and teamwork, as clans vie for control over valuable celestial territories and resources.

Mech vehicles will serve as formidable combat assets, granting players increased durability and firepower on both terrestrial and celestial battlefields. These powerful machines will enable players to assert their dominance in large-scale battles and test their combat prowess.

### Base Raiding <a name="base-raiding"></a>

Base raiding is a significant aspect of the game, as it provides an exciting and strategic way for clans to engage with one another, seize valuable loot, and take control of territory. To ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience for all players, the game employs a raid window mechanic that limits the times during which base destruction is possible.

#### Raid Window Mechanic

The raid window mechanic is designed to prevent griefing and to give players an opportunity to build up their bases or recover from battles. Base destruction is only permitted during specific time windows based on the server or shard timezones. This approach ensures that players have a fair chance to defend their bases and that attackers must plan their raids strategically to make the most of the limited time available.

During the designated raid windows, players can engage in thrilling base raids and battles, testing their combat skills and strategies against other clans. Successful raids can yield valuable loot and resources, as well as control over key territories, providing powerful incentives for players to engage in this challenging and rewarding aspect of the game.

### Respawn Mechanic

The respawn mechanic in the game is designed to evolve with the progression of the game's technology and the players' advancements.

#### Early Game: Sleeping Bags and Bed Cots

In the early stages of the game, players can use primitive respawn points such as sleeping bags and bed cots. These respawn points can be placed in limited locations, allowing players some control over where they re-enter the game after being killed.

#### Mid to Late Game: Cryopods and Cloning

As the game progresses and players unlock more advanced technology, they gain access to more sophisticated respawn options like cryopods and cloning facilities. These advanced respawn points allow players to respawn in more locations, including across different planetary systems.

#### Death Penalties

To prevent players from spamming suicides and exploiting the respawn system, there are penalties for dying. Players who are killed may receive debuffs such as slowed movement or temporary loss of memory (research progress). These penalties encourage players to strategize and avoid unnecessary deaths.

## Questing and Storyline <a name="questing-storyline"></a>

The game's storyline and lore are designed to build intrigue and mystery surrounding the nature of the game universe. Throughout the game, players will uncover easter eggs and hints that point to an ancient cataclysm that once destroyed the world and warnings against pushing the limits of technology too far.

### Ancient Cataclysm and Technology

Despite the warnings from the past, the current culture in the game is focused on harnessing the power of technology to benefit the universe and, ultimately, achieve Transcendence to avert any potential doom. The balance between technological advancement and the dangers it poses adds depth and complexity to the game's narrative.

### Dynamic NPC Quests

Questing in the game is primarily driven by the NPC population. As the game progresses and new Seals are unlocked, NPCs will dynamically generate quests that are tailored to the current state of the game world. These quests will provide players with exciting challenges and opportunities for character progression, while also serving to further the game's storyline.

In addition to being responsive to the state of the game world, the dynamic NPC quests will also be influenced by player actions. Algorithms will shape the NPC world based on the choices players make during quests, as well as their interactions with the NPC population, including PvE combat. As players make decisions that have a significant impact on the game world, the available opportunities for interaction with NPCs will evolve accordingly, creating a rich and dynamic world that reacts to player choices and actions.

This dynamic system ensures that players' decisions have lasting consequences and helps to create a truly immersive and engaging experience, where every choice can potentially shape the future of the game world.

### Dynamic Dungeon and Event Generation

To keep the gameplay experience fresh and engaging, the game will feature a system for dynamically generating dungeons and events based on the current state of the game world. This system will create a wide variety of challenges and experiences for players to explore, ranging from traditional dungeon raids to large-scale events involving warring NPC factions.

For example, players might encounter a traditional dungeon where they are tasked with raiding an NPC town or hideout to recover valuable resources or uncover important information. These dungeons will be procedurally generated, ensuring that no two raids are exactly the same and providing players with unique challenges each time they embark on such a quest.

In addition to traditional dungeons, the dynamic event generation system will also create large-scale events that can drastically alter the game world. One such event could involve two warring NPC factions engaging in an epic battle, with players having the option to intervene and choose a side to support or simply try to profit from the chaos. These events will provide players with opportunities to make meaningful choices that can impact the game world, while also offering exciting and diverse gameplay experiences.

## Character Abilities and Customization <a name="character-abilities"></a>

In Path to Ragnarok, players will have the freedom to shape their character's abilities and playstyle through the research trees, rather than being locked into a traditional class system. This approach allows for a high degree of customization and adaptation as the game progresses in real-time, enabling players to explore and experiment with various roles and strategies.

For example, a player who is interested in a trading and economic playstyle might choose to focus on research related to trading, commerce, and diplomacy. As they progress through the Currency and Trade Seal research tree, they could unlock new abilities, tools, and perks that enhance their effectiveness as a merchant, negotiator, or transporter.

Conversely, a player who prefers a combat-oriented playstyle might invest in research related to weapon proficiency, armor, and tactical maneuvers. This progression could lead to the development of powerful combat abilities, enhanced weapon and armor crafting, and a greater understanding of battlefield tactics, making them a formidable opponent in both PvP and PvE encounters.

By offering a diverse range of research options and allowing players to customize their characters through their choices, Path to Ragnarok encourages experimentation, collaboration, and strategic decision-making, all while providing a unique and personalized gameplay experience.

## Business Model and Monetization <a name="business-model-and-monetization"></a>

Path to Ragnarok aims to provide a fair and enjoyable gaming experience while offering various ways for players to support the game's development and ongoing maintenance. The business model consists of an initial game purchase, in-game purchases, and a premium subscription model, all while maintaining game balance and avoiding pay-to-win mechanics.

These items will not provide any in-game advantages and are purely for aesthetic purposes, allowing players to personalize their characters, vehicles and bases.

### Premium Subscription: Season Pass

Path to Ragnarok will also offer a premium subscription model in the form of a Season Pass. This subscription will grant players access to exclusive rewards, such as unique cosmetic items, special in-game events, and other bonuses. The focus will remain on maintaining a balanced gameplay experience, ensuring that premium subscribers do not gain an unfair advantage over other players.

By adopting a balanced monetization strategy, Path to Ragnarok aims to provide a fair and enjoyable experience for all players while generating revenue to support the game's continued development and success.

## End Game Content and Replayability <a name="end-game-content-and-replayability"></a>

In Path to Ragnarok, the end game content is designed to challenge the advanced level of the player base, emphasize the urgency of the coming doom, and offer a climactic experience as players race to unlock the final seal and escape the impending catastrophe.

### Expanded Raid Windows and Aggressive NPCs

As players progress toward the end game, raid windows will expand, and NPCs will become more aggressive. This increased difficulty not only balances the advanced capabilities of the player base but also creates a sense of urgency and tension as the world moves closer to its cataclysmic end.

### Cataclysmic Events

During the end game, planet-wide cataclysmic events will occur, with the potential to completely annihilate cities and player bases. These events are designed as a climax for the current season, pushing players to desperately strive for the final seal and escape the impending doom.

### Balancing Mechanics and Dynamic Strategy

To maintain balance and encourage dynamic strategic planning, Path to Ragnarok incorporates several mechanics that adjust the in-game experience based on a player's performance. Clans that lag behind will receive additional access to resources early in the game, while top clans will gain access to exclusive items in the late game.

For example, if a top clan built a specific freighter in the previous game, they could access it once they unlock certain research in the new game. These mechanics create a more balanced and dynamic gameplay experience that caters to players of all skill levels and strategies.

### Replayability

The end game content in Path to Ragnarok is designed to offer a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to each season while also encouraging players to return for future seasons. The dynamic nature of the game's challenges and the ongoing evolution of the game world ensures that each new season offers a fresh and exciting experience for players to enjoy.

## Technical Considerations <a name="technical"></a>

### Procedurally Generated World and Universe

Each season, the game world and universe will be procedurally generated to provide a unique and engaging experience for players. This approach ensures that the environment remains fresh and challenging, offering players new opportunities for exploration and discovery.

### Algorithms and Systems

Various algorithms and systems will be implemented to support the game's mechanics, such as dynamic NPC quests, dynamic dungeon and event generation, and the procedurally generated universe. These systems will be designed to adapt to player actions and create a rich, evolving game world.

### Architecture: Shard System

The game's architecture will be built around a shard system, allowing players to connect to a regional shard closely associated with their physical location in the real world. This approach ensures optimal performance and latency, providing a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience for players across the globe.
